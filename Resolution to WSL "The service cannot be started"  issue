Hi, I am JoÃ£o, from Brazil

And today I am gonna do a simple teach about a issue problem can that happen in your WSL2 on Windows 11

What's happenned with me, was when I tried run the WSL2 and the program showed the follow message:

PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> wsl
The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it.

I solve this with my searches and I found the follow solution and conclusion
This happen for because of the antivirus, generally the Kaspersky, that blocks linux apps for security questions

To desative this, just enough type the follow code in your PowerShell:

sc config LxssManager start=auto

This should resolve the problem
